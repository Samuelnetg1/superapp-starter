# Introduction to superapps

Superapps are defined as applications that provide end users, be it employees, partners, or customers, with access to independently created mini apps. These mini apps are unified under a single umbrella application, so users don’t need to hop between digital experiences. The core application contains essential functionality, such as authentication and payments, while the mini apps can add on needed features.

In some cases, this can mean having an app directory within the app. In other cases, the workflow between apps can be much more seamless.

We don’t think that the “super” in superapps necessarily means that you need to have an in-app app store with thousands of apps to download. Instead, superapps allow the user to have one single app that shapes their experience for that specific company or brand, regardless of whether it’s a consumer superapp or a workplace superapp.
