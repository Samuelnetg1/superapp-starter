# Building Your First Ionic Superapp

The purpose of this guide is to walk through a step-by-step process of building your very first superapp using the Ionic Platform. In short order, you will have created the beginnings of your enterprise's superapp by leveraging the existing services within Ionic. Once you're completed with this cookbook, you'll be well on your way to building out an amazing superapp experience for your internal workforce or customers!

## Register your Product Key

For this guide to work, you will need to have an Ionic Portals Key. If you do not have a key already, follow the steps [outlined here](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/getting-started#using-your-product-key). With that settled you will have access to:

- [Portals](https://ionic.io/docs/portals): A supercharged native WebView component for iOS and Android that lets you add web-based experiences to native mobile apps. It enables native and web teams to better collaborate and bring new and existing web experiences to mobile in a safe, controlled way.

## What will you build?

Your completed application will integrate [Portals](https://ionic.io/docs/portals/) into an iOS application. Each portal will be home to an Ionic app built using a different framework: [React](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react), [Angular](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/overview), and [Vue](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/overview). These mini apps that are embedded into the superapp via Portals are powered by [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).

## TL;DR

If you would like to jump ahead and get the completed code for your own investigation before you get started, you can grab it from [GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/superapp-starter).
